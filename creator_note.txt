Thank you for choosing to use or work on Baxter.

Different models may yield different behaviors. 

OpenAI is a bit slower but throurough and cautios.

Anthropic is creative and very smart.

Groq is lightning fast but not nearly as capable although it depends on which model you use.
At this time we only have default support for Llama 3.1 8b but you can modify the code to support other models.

Contributors are welcome. Anyone who is serious about building Baxter as part of a team can reach out to me directly to talk further.
