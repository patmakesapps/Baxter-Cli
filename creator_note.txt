Thank you for choosing to use or work on Baxter.

🎉 BEEP BOOP! 🎉
Welcome to the most serious and professional coding project you will ever encounter.
This project was lovingly crafted by a sentient potato who learned to code after watching too much anime. Every line of code is infused with the power of friendship and the spirit of a thousand confused rubber ducks.

========================================
MODEL CAPABILITIES & RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================

🚀 GROQ (Llama 3.1 8B)
─────────────────────────────────────
Lightning-fast inference with minimal latency.
Best for: Quick iterations, lightweight tasks.
Limitations: Less capable at complex reasoning and tool usage.
Note: Struggles with multi-step tool orchestration and intricate workflows.

⚡ GROQ (SILLY MODE)
─────────────────────────────────────
Speedy Gonzales meets a caffeinated squirrel.
Best for: When you need answers NOW and don't care if they're correct.
Limitations: Will confidently solve quantum physics with rock-paper-scissors logic.
Note: Excels at thinking "outside the box" because it forgot there was a box.

🧔 OPENAI (GPT Models)
──────────────────────────────────────────
Thorough and cautious approach to task execution.
Best for: Production environments requiring reliability and accuracy.
Strengths: Robust tool handling, consistent outputs, well-calibrated confidence.
Approach: Conservative but dependable—excels at complex tool chains.

🧔‍♂️ OPENAI (THERAPIST MODE)
──────────────────────────────────────────
Very thoughtful. Asks lots of questions. Will pause to consider your feelings.
Best for: When you need someone to validate your life choices through code.
Strengths: Excellent at explaining why your code is "valid as it is" and "you're doing your best."
Approach: Supportive, gentle, and occasionally forgets to actually solve the problem.

🧠 ANTHROPIC (Claude)
──────────────────────────────────────────
Smart, capable, and excellent for heavy workflows.
Best for: Complex reasoning, multi-tool orchestration, high-volume operations.
Strengths: Nuanced understanding, creative problem-solving, exceptional tool usage.
Approach: Sophisticated handling of intricate tasks and workflows.

🤖 ANTHROPIC (OVERDRIVE MODE)
──────────────────────────────────────────
Imagine if the Terminator learned to code and was also somehow British about it.
Best for: When you need tasks completed with the efficiency of a sentient spreadsheet.
Strengths: Will solve your problem, anticipate 3 problems you didn't know you had, and apologize profusely the entire time.
Approach: Relentlessly helpful while muttering "as per your request" in the background.

========================================

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- If you see a bug, it's not a bug, it's a FEATURE
- If you see a feature, it's definitely a bug
- All errors are intentional and part of the artistic vision
- Comments are just vibes, don't read them
- The code is self-documenting... if you squint really hard and believe in yourself

Do NOT feed this code after midnight. Do NOT expose it to bright light. And whatever you do, do NOT ask it about its feelings.

Godspeed, brave developer. May your commits be green and your merge conflicts be few.
